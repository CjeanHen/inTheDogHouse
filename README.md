# The Dog House
This application is made to store data about dogs in a shelter. I was inspired to do this project when I found an abandoned dog and took her to the shelter a few weeks ago. All of the intake work was done on paper and seemed like a poor way to handle the lives of these dogs. My hope is to continue improving this application to fully meet the record-keeping needs of the shelter and then to donate the software. In V1 the program can handle basic record keeping about the dogs almost like inventory, but in future versions it could store veterinary data and information about the home that they go to. Below are the different routes to bow-wow-api/dogs.

### Planning Story
The first step to creating the front-end was just to focus on creating the inputs and buttons necessary for the user to sign up and sign in. This was very familiar since it was the same process I followed with the previous project, so this time I made the sign up form a modal. After that I began with the authorized user routes which were the change password and sign out buttons. The dog forms were even more of the same, but I had trouble with the create routes because of how I was naming the inputs in the HTML. Most of my work after that was styling since I didn't want to have the page just a list of forms. I tried to add a bit of content to make it look more like a shelter page. Styling is not my strong point.

### User Stories
As a user I want to be able to create a new document for each new dog that enters the shelter.
As a user I want to be able to update the information about each dog.
As a user I want to be able to delete a dog once they're adopted.
As a user I don't want updates to be made by anyone who is not a registered user.

### Unsolved Problems
I would like to improve on my knowledge of UI and UX. It is very difficult for me to visualize a website, but I can easily follow requirements.
